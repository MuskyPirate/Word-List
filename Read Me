This is the list of passwords (to be best of ability) from the NAZ.API credential leak.

The purpose of this list is to assist with pentesting and that is why the list only contains passwords where any mentions of associated services and usernames have been removed.

The acquired list had passwords that exceeded 100 characters (some reaching even more). Therefore, in order to makes things simple I have capped the list to passwords that do not exceed 50 characters.

Some "passwords" were litterally the URL addresses or folder path which seems too unique to be in a wordlist, hence they were removed.

The list is checked for duplicates and sorted by length.
